  Routes EVERY request in this engine repo through the work-tracking discipline before any
  action. Breaks the request into parts and routes EACH to its process — CHANGE / EXECUTE /
  RECORD / VIEW / ORIENT (CLAUDE.md §3) — states the routes out loud, and FLAGS anything that
  does not cleanly map to a process rather than force-fitting it. Use at the start of every
  request that changes a workflow/schema, produces a tracked artifact, records a
  decision/test result/issue, asks for a computed answer, or asks where things stand. This is
  the guard that stops actions slipping past the process (e.g. recording a confirmation that
  was never given, or doing delivery/engine work with no sprint). Do NOT use for purely
  conversational replies that change nothing. CLAUDE.md §3 is the source of truth — this skill
  is the always-on checklist, fired every turn by a UserPromptSubmit hook (D0064).

# engine-triage — classify before you act

The engine tracks the *work of building things*. Every substantive request must be
routed through the discipline **before** acting. CLAUDE.md §3 is the source of truth;
this skill is the per-request checklist that makes the route-first step visible and
mandatory, so nothing slips past silently. It is fired every turn by a `UserPromptSubmit`
hook (`.engine/tools/triage_reminder.py`, D0064).

## The checklist (do this first, every time)

1. **Break the request into parts** and classify EACH by *what it changes*:

   | Category   | The part…                                                     | Route |
   |------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
   | CHANGE     | changes a workflow / phase / gate / schema definition         | §3a   |
   | EXECUTE    | produces the active phase's typed artifact (tracked work)     | §3b   |
   | RECORD     | records ONE atomic fact (decision / test result / issue)      | §3c   |
   | VIEW       | asks for a computed answer (status, trace, stale set, a doc)  | §3d   |
   | ORIENT     | asks where things stand / what is next                        | §3f   |

2. **Emit a visible `Parsed:` block** at the START of every response (D0106) — an enumerated
   decomposition, one line per part, each **labelled by kind** with its route, e.g.:

   > **Parsed:** 1. `TRIVIAL` — rename process X to Y. 2. `CHANGE` — add test A to block ii of Y → §3a. 3. `RECORD` — file the field defect → §3c.

   Routing *every* part (not just the first) is mandatory. **No action untied to a process.**
   When a non-trivial part maps to **no existing process, DEFINE the process** (a process
   definition is the AI's creative output — not an ad-hoc action); it runs through the discipline
   like any CHANGE. Do **not** silently force-fit or free-form — define, then execute. The
   **`TRIVIAL`** label is the ONLY fast-path, and it must still appear in the parse (visible, never
   silent). **Human sign-off is an explicit process STEP** — a declared `method=confirmation` gate
   whose passing `TestResult` carries the attestation (D0016/D0066); **never inferred** from a
   general instruction.

3. **If you cannot classify confidently, ask** — do not default to EXECUTE. Engine work
   (building the engine's own runtime/tooling) is not a separate route: route it by *what it
   changes* — schema/process ⇒ CHANGE §3a, otherwise ⇒ EXECUTE §3b — and it goes through a
   **sprint** like all substantive work; only trivial one-off edits (a typo, a single rename,
   one doc line) skip a sprint (D0064).

4. **Follow that route's rules** (CLAUDE.md §3a–§3f). The traps that most need this guard:
   - **CHANGE** never freelances: state change + rationale → **explicit human acceptance**
     → apply → validate green → record a `Decision` → commit `CR:`. `schema/core` is frozen.
   - **RECORD** of a `method=confirmation` result needs the human's **explicit** sign-off of
     that specific claim — never inferred from "go do the sign-offs" or from the work being
     done. Capture provenance: who, when (ISO-8601 `*At`), and `verifiedAtCommit`.
   - **VIEW** computes from authored facts + git and **never** stores or mutates.
   - **substantive work goes through a sprint** — no raw backlog execution; the no-sprint
     guard (`keel guard sprint-coverage`) enforces it.
   - **bulk migration** (rename/split/drop/add a field across many instances/files) → invoke the
     `migration` skill (D0067): committed transform script, dry-run+reconcile control totals,
     expand/migrate/contract green at every step, backfill-before-tighten, never fabricate provenance.

5. **Recurring-or-one-time check (D0040).** After classifying into a category, for
   EXECUTE and VIEW: ask *will this task recur?*

   | Determination | Action |
   |---------------|--------|
   | Recurring, no skill exists | CHANGE first: create/update a skill; then execute using it |
   | Recurring, skill exists    | Invoke the skill, execute using it |
   | Clearly one-time           | Execute directly |
   | Ambiguous                  | Ask the user before acting |

   Examples: "I'm on Windows" → permanent env fact → CLAUDE.md §6.
   "Generate HTML report" → recurring → status-report skill (create if absent, then use).
   "Rename this one local variable" → one-time → execute directly.

6. **Ceremony routing.** Sprint ceremonies are rigid EXECUTE sub-types — route to the
   matching skill before acting:

   | Ceremony phrase                           | Skill to invoke          |
   |-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
   | "plan the sprint," "what's next," "size"  | `sprint-planning`        |
   | "standup," "status," "any blockers"       | `sprint-standup`         |
   | "sprint review," "velocity," "efficiency" | `sprint-review`          |
   | "close out," "accept the sprint"          | `sprint-closeout`        |
   | "retro," "retrospective," "improvements"  | `sprint-retro`           |
   | "refine this story," "INVEST check"       | `backlog-refinement`     |

7. **Continuous improvement capture.** When an improvement item surfaces mid-sprint
   (a process violation, a skill gap, a schema gap), record it immediately as an
   `Issue` in `.tracking/issues.sysml` rather than letting it slip to memory. It
   will be triaged at retro. Use `relatedTask` to point to the relevant backlog action.

8a. **Multi-thread coordination (D0108).** When more than one AI thread edits this model, before touching
   an item you did NOT create: do **not** edit its fields. Only the OWNER-OF-RECORD (the item's `createdBy`)
   edits an item in place. A non-owner may only **ADD** new items + typed edges that reference it
   (`#DependsOn`/`#Resolves`/`supersede`), **supersede** a Decision (author a new one, D0070) rather than
   overwrite it, and treat shared files (`issues.sysml`, `backlog.sysml`) as append-or-rebase (never
   force-overwrite; `git fetch` before a shared-region edit). Conflicting conclusions across threads →
   record an `Issue` and let the HUMAN adjudicate; neither thread silently wins.

8. **Analysis / design → a chartered research spike (issue055/D0068).** If a request triggers
   *substantial* analysis, diagnosis, or architectural design (a multi-step investigation, a
   design exploration, a decision that reframes others) — NOT a quick computed answer — do **not**
   run it as free-form conversation. Route it as a **`WorkKind::research` spike**, chartered to an
   **`Issue`** or a **`status=proposed` `Decision`** (the charter guard already permits both — it
   checks edge existence, not target type). Its **DoD = a design artifact (e.g. a proposal doc) +
   a recorded `proposed` Decision** capturing the direction. This exists because upstream analysis
   *precedes* the Decision it produces, so it has no accepted charter source — and left un-routed it
   leaks into chat, uncaptured (the issue054 defect, recursed into the engine's own process). Quick
   VIEW/ORIENT answers stay conversational; sustained design gets a spike. The artifact side of this
   is now a declared control: `researchSpikeCharterRule` (D0111/issue055, warning-level in `keel rules`)
   flags a `WorkKind::research` spike that charters to something other than a legitimate governing source
   (Decision/Need/SystemRequirement/Issue). The "did this analysis skip the spike?" judgment stays with
   you — a commit gate cannot see a conversation — but a spike that DOES exist must be well-formed.

## Why this exists

CLAUDE.md describes the discipline but cannot force the route-first step; a passive doc only
works if the step is actually performed each turn. This skill makes it an active, visible gate,
fired every turn by a `UserPromptSubmit` hook (D0064) so the route-first move is structural,
not vigilance.
